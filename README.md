#### Siq2json2

Converts the packages for [SiGame](https://vladimirkhil.com/si/game) from xml to json

SiGame currently doesn't support json format, this npm module was made for VRChat.


```
npm i -g siq2json2

siq <path/to/file.siq>
```

This will create a `scenario.json` file in the directory as the original package file name.

For the structure of a json, refer to bin/index.d.ts file
